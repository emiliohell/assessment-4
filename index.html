      <p>
        During this final period of my Hyper journey, I am doing my internship at a company called Epidemic Sound - its
        a
        company I wanted to join right at the start. </p>

      <p>
        The knowledge and experience in this case has been squarely focused on the way Epidemic works in the group that
        I was in, and the tech stack corresponding to the part of the product that team was taken care of.
      </p>




      <p>
        The team I was in is called Acquisition, it's the team that takes care of the first part of the website
        Epidemicsound.com, essentially all the public pages on the site.
      </p>

      <p>The internship started with some small lectures about different systems that Epidemic has with our mentor, that
        evolved to us coding our own small version of their site - this was to get acquainted with how they work - to
        then finally
        start picking up tickets and start contributing to the team.</p>
      <p>I'll go into more details in the next sections, where I go through each course goal and explain how I have
        achieved, completed or interacted with the goals during my internship.</p>

      <h1 class="center section-title"><em>The Web App </em>üîä</h1>

      <p>
        The basic idea for this web app stemmed from being able to present more information about the song that you are
        listening to, than Spotify provides in their own applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within
        Spotify you can see Similar artist, Records and Bio. But what I wanted to present, was the track analysis that
        Spotify collects on all tracks, but does not show.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to help DJ¬¥s know what BPM and Key the song is in, so they can find and test other songs that match and
        thus create a playlist that is cohesive in tempo and melody - a bonus is also that my web app shows you the
        record label that the track is from, so you can explore similar artists from the same record label.
      </p>

      <p>Please try the application in the link below!<br><em>(You will need to have a Spotify account, all the sent
          data is between you and Spotify.)</em></p>

      <h3 class="interpretation" style="color: black">
        <em>Knowledge and experience in various development methods and work processes, and above all agile system
          development method.</em>
      </h3>
      <p>The work process and development method consists mainly around the Kan-Ban board that the whole team shares,
        this is where we add tickets ourselves with issues or improvement for the product we own or get tickets from
        other teams
        that fall in our area.</p>
      <p>The team consists of a designer, developers, a product manager and a data scientist that are all working from
        this Kan-Ban board.</p>
      <p>Essentially the team has access to all of what is needed to develop and improve on the product in their area,
        for example, a ticket about an AB test can come in from the management - the data scientist explores what data
        is needed for the test, the product manager and designer creates a visual demo of how this experiment is gonna
        look like, and finally the developers take over to create the said test. This order is only an example, this
        varies a lot on the ticket itself and what is needed to solve it. </p>
      <p>In a nutshell that is how the agile system works in this team, too keep the team communicating and working as a
        team, we have regular on going meetings where we communicate as much as possible.</p>
      <p>The team meetings always starts with the daily morning stand up with the whole team, where the team can talk
        about on going issues, speak up about anything that is needed to be adressed, as well as just having a nice
        relaxed chat about anything - we always end with every person telling the team how their day is gonna look like
        and finish with an inspirational quote from a bot. (https://inspirobot.me/)</p>
      <p>Next up are the weekly refinement meetings, here we take a look at our backlog for the entire team and talk
        more specific about ongoing tickets and things that should be lifted up or prioritised in the ticket queue - its
        a great way of making sure that the whole team is aware of the backlog and it keeps communication between
        everyone in the team.</p>
      <p>We are usually always reminded during these that the whole team owns the backlog and that tickets should also
        be created by the team itself - it's imperative that the team is heavily involved with the product so that
        improvements can always be made.</p>
      <p>Last in these regular meetings are the bi weekly retrospectives, the structure of this meeting is to write
        things that are good, bad and that you are wondering about, in your workplace - this can be about cases, other
        teams, how the team works or sometimes just personal feelings, these meetings are great to urge and open for a
        discussion on different topics, and check how the team is feeling.</p>
      <p>These are the main meetings that the work process are based on, for the team to keep communicating and
        interacting with each-other, as everything is remote, its a challenge to keep everyone engaged.</p>
      <p>From my perspective, you join these meetings regularly to keep interaction with the team and then pick
        up/create your own tickets from the backlog and work on them.</p>
      <p>I think that this was a great way of working and i think that it has enough breathing room for the team to not
        feel pressured, but have a self motivating spirit to deliver a better product - in a way your creating your own
        destiny, which is something that I personally feel is very inspiring. </p>
      <p>To do things because you have to is not as fun as doing things that you want to.</p>

        <em>Methods of quality assurance.</em>
      </h3>
      <p>The methods of quality assurance at Epidemic consists of checking each others work before deploying the change,
        test or fix to the production site.</p>
      <p>For example, a developer has solved a bug on the site and is now ready to deploy this fix to the live website -
        before the developer is able to deploy their fix, they have to create a pull request in GitHub, which will need
        to pass certain tests that are made when creating the PR.</p>
      <p>If the requests pass all these automatic tests, then the developer needs another developer to look at the code
        and approve it, once approved the developer can start to deploy it - during this process, another set of
        automatic tests will launch, these are similar to the automatic tests that where made right at the start of this
        PR .</p>
      <p>Once the developer passes all the tests and has an approval of a colleague, the fix can finally go live and
        into the production site. </p>
      <p>This type of system keeps the developer to deploy bugs or non working code to the site, as its usually checked
        by
        several people, and if all fails - you can always backtrack the deployment.</p>
      <p>We emulated this when we where working on our individual project, where we built a mini version of the website
        - every time you where ready to deploy new code to Git Hub, our mentor at the time checked the code and left
        comments on how to improve before we deployed it.</p>
      <p>I think that this is a great system to keep everything in check, it involves your colleagues, you open doors to
        learn from each-other and create discussions about solutions and code.</p>

        <em>Choose work and project methodology and make independent decisions about planning and work according to
          requirements specifications against set quality requirements in delivery.
        </em>
      </h3>
      <p>I think that the way we work at Epidemic leaves room for how you work independently on tickets. </p>
      <p>For me, the work process has been that I check the backlog for tickets, if I find any interesting ones, I can
        message my mentor, they will check if the ticket is applicable to me and not a high priority, as they will
        probably take a little longer to complete.</p>
      <p>When it has been approved by my mentor, I pick up the ticket and usually always begin by creating a Notion page
        to work from - here I can reinterpret the ticket and start gather information on how to solve it.</p>
      <p>This includes articles, own notes, todo lists and code as well.</p>
      <p>I also use this page to show my mentor my progress and collect questions I have, that sometimes I answer myself
        by doing research or my mentor resolves for me.</p>
      <p>I think its a good balance between me working with my own tools, but incorporating the mentors and have a
        watching eye over you so that you dont get stuck for too long, if the ticket at hand is very hard to solve.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The regular meetings mentioned above coupled with the quality insurance way of approving code, automatically
        creates collaboration within the team. </p>
      <p>I also think that its in the corporations DNA to collaborate, to be able to solve certain issues you have to
        communicate with other teams or people in other teams - as code could have been created by a person that is now
        in a new team.</p>

      <p>At the team I was in, our goal was to convert as many new visitors as possible - every experiment we create or
        fix is to make the journey of a new client as smooth as possible, for them to register as a paying customer at
        Epidemic.</p>
      <p>Our connection with the end clients are manly based of reports that the data scientist delivers to the team,
        usually its they who have most of the data - but of course the data is also available to the whole team.</p>
      <p>They help us improve the website and tests hypothesis on how we can increase the conversion-rate or fix a
        possible drop of clients.</p>
