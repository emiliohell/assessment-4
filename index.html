        <p>
          For this project I decided to make a smaller web application for DJ's using JavaScript and the Spotify API.
        </p>

        <p>
          I choose to work with the Spotify API because Spotify is my most frequently used application on all my devices. The idea of being able to create tools for services that I use on my devices is great source of inspiration, I can see how I can benefit from it in the future, for example discover more music with less interaction.
      </p>




    <p>

        Because I did not have any experience with the Spotify API, I decided that I wanted the project to be very minimalistic - a goal of mine was to make something very simple, but execute it as good as I possibly can, with all the skills i have acquired during my time at 
          Hyper Island.
        </p>

        <p>Essentially, I wanted this project to be a culmination of my learnings.</p>

        <h1 class="center section-title"><em>The Web App </em>üîä</h1>

        <p>
          The basic idea for this web app stemmed from being able to present more information about the song that you are listening to, than  Spotify provides in their own applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within
          Spotify you can see Similar artist, Records and Bio. But what I wanted to present, was the track analysis that Spotify collects on all tracks, but does not show.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to help DJ¬¥s know what BPM and Key the song is in, so they can find and test other songs that match and thus create a playlist that is cohesive in tempo and melody - a bonus is also that my web app shows you the record label that the track is from, so you can explore similar artists from the same record label.

          <em>Take responsibility for and carrying out planning in relation to
            the specialized tasks and tasks in user interface-oriented
            development of websites, web services and applications.</em>
        </h3>
        <p>
          For this project I began with making a site in Notion - <em>see the link below</em> - this is where I collect all the information about the project and where all the planning stages appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to have everything in one place which Notion
          is very good at <em>(compared to Google Docs)</em>,
          Notion
          has also been the preferred way of keeping notes for the previous projects I have worked with.
        </p>
        <p>
          To remember the focus of the project, I listed the brief on top, as well as the main functionality, goals and my design in Figma - where I did all the design - I also created a Task/To-Do list to keep track of everything I need to get done and a database with relevant links and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan was to start with the design so I have a visual demo that I can follow, I wanted to make the idea less abstract than if I keep it in my head or have it written in words, the development is much easier when the design and functionality are already set.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the design was done, I started to code the very basic "engine" of the project, essentially just getting any information from the API - when I succeeded getting the data i wanted from the API, I started to print it on the website and then began with the CSS and style of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as i felt I had a stable MVP ready, I started to troubleshoot and user testing, so that I can extract and fix as many bugs as possible - this ongoing during the whole coding phase and is still ongoing, I do not believe perfect code exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last step of my developing plan was to add more functions, unfortunately that is still being under production - what I am trying to do now is to add a list of recommended tracks that match the track you are listening to in melody and tempo - to alleviate even more work from the user.

        <p>This goal was incorporated into my planning phase. </p>
        <p>Because I am one person in this project with a deadline of 25th September, my time planning was very simple:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong>1.</strong> One week to come up with a project and setup a structure around the project.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>2.</strong> One week to develop the design.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong>3.</strong> The rest of the time follows an agile type of developing, keeping that loop of coding and troubleshooting - I tried to do as much as possible before the deadline and my minimum requirement was to have a MVP done with clean, dry and well though out code.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong>4.</strong> If the MVP was done, then I could start to add another function.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          The resources was gathered during the creation of the Notion page in the database table and the techniques/tech stack was already decided during the start of my project.<br>

        <p>I think these last two course goals are very hard to interpreter and should be rewritten into something much clearer and understandable - I think course goals should be clear and not too abstract, otherwise they will not be a source of inspiration and something to aim for, rather they will confuse and throw you off. I know I am not alone in this criticism.</p>
        <p>
          With that said - I am summing both of them into one and reinterpreting them.

        <p>
          I think I achieved my goal of this project becoming a culmination of everything I have learned during my time at Hyper Island. If I reflect over all the techniques I have learned, the only ''skill'' I did not use in this project was the ability to learn new tech and develop with tech that I have not used before, an example would be to incorporate a backend with Node in this project without having used it before.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I did not want to spend time creating something that was "glued" together, I wanted to apply what I know and write all my code from scratch without using tutorials or other peoples code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A must for me when incorporating tech that I have not used before, is the necessity of using tutorials and trying several different solutions - without knowing its consequences - for me to troubleshoot or clean up the code is not possible without a clear base knowledge that take some time to acquire.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes the code in this project, my goal was not to build a "house of cards" if you will, my goal was to build a "bunker".  
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that the creation of this project was a great experience, because it gave me a clear vision of what I have learned during my time at Hyper Island. To create something I want to use for myself with tech that I use in my daily living made it a lot of fun and inspiring, the project has given birth to several new ideas that I hope to be able to create in the future as well as a confidence to create things for myself to simplify my own living.
